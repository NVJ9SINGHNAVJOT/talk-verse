## Current Implementation and Future Improvements

#### In the current version of our application:

- Socket IDs and Channels Storage: Currently, userSocketIDs, groupOffline, and channels mapping is stored in the server..
- Server Configuration: Both the HTTP and WebSocket servers run on the same port.


#### For future scalability and efficiency:

- Redis for Storage: We can replace the Map with Redis to store userSocketIDs, groupOffline, and channels. This will allow us to handle a larger number of connections and provide better performance.
- Multiple WebSocket Servers: To support multiple WebSocket servers, we can use the Redis adapter for Socket.IO. This ensures that events are propagated across all server instances, maintaining a consistent state across the application.

## Current Implementation and Future Improvements

#### In the current version of our application:

- Socket IDs and Channels Storage: We use a Map to store the mappings of user IDs to socket IDs and channels.
- Server Configuration: Both the HTTP and WebSocket servers run on the same port.


#### For future scalability and efficiency:

- Redis for Storage: We can replace the Map with Redis to store socket IDs and channels. This will allow us to handle a larger number of connections and provide better performance.
- Multiple WebSocket Servers: To support multiple WebSocket servers, we can use the Redis adapter for Socket.IO. This ensures that events are propagated across all server instances, maintaining a consistent state across the application.

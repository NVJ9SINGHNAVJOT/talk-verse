## Features

1. #### User Authentication :

   - TalkVerse ensures secure user registration and authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**. Users can easily sign up, log in, and manage their profiles with confidence.
   - **Bcrypt** is used for password hashing, adding an extra layer of security to user data.

2. #### Application Stack :

   - The web application is built using TypeScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. These technologies form the foundation for its functionality and user interface.

3. #### Secure Chat with Encryption :

   - The chat feature incorporates both **asymmetric and symmetric encryption** methods. This ensures that user messages remain confidential and protected.

4. #### Real-Time Communication :

   - Websockets are employed to enable live chat functionality. Users can engage in real-time conversations, making the application dynamic and responsive.

5. #### Messaging Channels :

   - Channels organize message operations within the application.

6. #### Blogging and Post Creation :

   - Users have the ability to create and share blog posts or other content. This feature encourages engagement and content sharing.

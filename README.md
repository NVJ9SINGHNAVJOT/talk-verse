# TalkVerse

TalkVerse is a social media web application.

## Note

- This project is created for learning purposes and can be used as a personal project.
- It **_can be deployed on a live server_** as **_all features_** all fully **_operational_**.

---

## Features

#### User Authentication :

- TalkVerse ensures secure user registration and authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**. Users can easily sign up, log in, and manage their profiles with confidence.
- **Bcrypt** is used for password hashing, adding an extra layer of security to user data.

#### Application Stack :

- The web application is built using TypeScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. These technologies form the foundation for its functionality and user interface.

#### Secure Chat with Encryption :

- The chat feature incorporates both **asymmetric and symmetric encryption** methods. This ensures that user messages remain confidential and protected.

#### Real-Time Communication :

- Websockets are employed to enable live chat functionality. Users can engage in real-time conversations, making the application dynamic and responsive.

#### Kafka as a Message Broker :

- Efficiently handles real-time data streams.
- Ensures reliable message delivery and fault tolerance.
- Scales seamlessly to accommodate high-throughput data pipelines.

#### Golang for Concurrently Handling Messages :

- Utilizes Goâ€™s goroutines for efficient concurrent processing.
- Manages Kafka messages and MongoDB operations simultaneously.
- Enhances performance and responsiveness of the system.

#### Messaging Channels :

- Channels organize message operations within the application.

#### Blogging and Post Creation :

- Users have the ability to create and share blog posts or other content. This feature encourages engagement and content sharing.

## Installation

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/NVJ9SINGHNAVJOT/talk-verse.git
  ```
- Set up environment variables.
  In the root directory inside

  - /backend/databases
  - /backend/server
  - /backend/consumer
  - /frontend

  **.env.example** file is present. Replace it with **.env** file and set the required variables running application _(.env.example contains all variables examples)_.

- Project can be run on local machine by Docker or by installing dependencies locally.
- **Using Docker:** **_Recommended for Production_**

  ```sh
  cd talk-verse
  task compose-up-backend
  task compose-up-frontend
  ```

- Open the project in your browser at [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173).

- **Using local machine dependencies:** **_Recommended for Development_**

1. Install Node.js (skip if already installed).
2. Install Golang (skip if already installed).
3. Install the required packages and start the servers.
4. If you have Apache Kafka installed locally, skip the _task dev-kafka_ and _task dev-kafka-topics_ steps, and create the topics as described in the _this_create_kafka_topics.sh_ file. Otherwise, start Docker (Apache Kafka is used in this project with Docker) and execute the following task commands:

   ```sh
   cd talk-verse
   task i
   task dev-kafka
   task dev-kafka-topics
   # task dev runs consumer, server, and client concurrently
   task dev
   ```

- Open the project in your browser at [`http://localhost:4173`](http://localhost:4173).
- You can execute the **_task_** command in the terminal to view all the available commands in the task file.

## Important

- PostgreSQL: Drizzle ORM is used for PostgreSQL. After any change in the schema, new SQL schemas need to be generated by Drizzle Kit by running the command **npm run postgresqldb:generate**. After this, restart the backend server.
